.SYNOPSIS
    Says, loudly, whether the release binaries came out signed or not.

.DESCRIPTION
    Signing is optional, so "is this build signed?" is a question somebody has to answer later. Answered in four
    places: a table in the build log, an AppVeyor build message, the SIGNING_* build variables the deploy step
    quotes, and optionally a markdown block on disk.

    Read off the files themselves, not inferred from "the signing step ran".

.PARAMETER Path
    Files to report on.

.PARAMETER NotesPath
    Where to write the markdown block. Skipped when not given.

.PARAMETER RequireSigned
    Fail when anything is not validly signed. Set when signing was supposed to happen.

    # counter-signature format on older Windows - the AppVeyor images report nothing for the RFC 3161 token that

    # value is reported as absent knowledge, rather than as a binary that will expire with its certificate.
