.SYNOPSIS
    The signing half of an AppVeyor release build: install SimplySign, log in, sign, report.

.DESCRIPTION
    appveyor.yml has no step-level conditions, so the two decisions live here:

      - Only tag builds sign. A run downloads a 260 MB installer and spends a one-time code; branch builds are
        never published. -Force overrides.
      - Signing is optional. Without the CERTUM_* variables the build still produces artifacts, unsigned, and
        says so.

    Called from after_build, before the archives are zipped.

.PARAMETER Path
    Binaries to sign.

.PARAMETER Description
    signtool /d for files with no FileDescription of their own. BadApp.exe has one, so this is a safety net
    rather than the usual path.

.PARAMETER Force
    Sign a non-tag build, for testing the flow.

.NOTES
    One call per build, all platforms at once: a second login in the same 30-second TOTP step reuses the code,
    which Certum may refuse. See ci/SIGNING.md.
