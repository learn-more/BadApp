.SYNOPSIS
    Appends a changelog to the release notes, one bullet per commit subject.

.DESCRIPTION
    Subject lines only. A commit body is written for someone reading the history; someone downloading a binary
    wants the one-line version.

    The release is created as a draft, so this is a starting point to edit in the UI rather than the final text.

    Appends, so the signing banner from certum-signing runs first and stays on top.

.PARAMETER Tag
    The tag being released, e.g. v0.9.0.

.PARAMETER NotesPath
    Markdown file to append to. Created if it does not exist.

.PARAMETER PreviousTag
    Start of the range. Defaults to the previous release tag reachable from $Tag; without one, the whole history.

.PARAMETER ExcludePattern
    Subjects matching this regex are left out, case-insensitively. Defaults to the "ci:" prefix: a change to the
    workflow that built the binary is not a change to the binary. Pass '' to keep everything.

.PARAMETER RepoRoot
    Passed as -C to git, so this works regardless of the current directory. Defaults to this repository.

# released after v0.9.0-rc1 would list only the handful of commits that landed since the rc. '*-*' excludes the
